								<h3>The Origin of Digital Art</h3>
								<p>
									During the 1960s, when the modern computer was still in its rudimentary beginnings, scientists and mathematicians began to experiment with the concept of digitally simulated art. From this point onward the limitless creative potential of the digital medium was envisaged. As computers became more omnipresent in households a group of curious traditional artists made the leap towards technology and pioneered a new era of digital art. In 1990 the juggernaut of graphics editing software (Photoshop) was released, transforming the mouse into a powerful artistic tool capable of mimicking any pencil or brush. Two-dimensional visual art was no longer restricted to a material plane and the artist no longer limited to their environment. An entirely new skill-set would need to be invented and refined to succeed as a digital artist. Unsurprisingly, this artistic movement was greeted with caution. In the eyes of many, the technology superseded the artist and, not for the first time, begged the question, is this <i>real art</i>? 
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>The Real Art Dilemma</h3>
								<p>
									To understand the <i>real art</i> label it is worthwhile examining the definition of each word. <i>Real</i> is an adjective used to convey the genuineness of the subject, neither imitative nor artificial. <i>Art</i> is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. Immediately it is evident in these definitions where the criticism of digital art stems from. It is perceived as an imitation of real art, artificially constructed and, hence, devoid of any emotional significance or artistic integrity. Digital artists can be ridiculed as frauds that exploit software to automate laborious tasks and inflate their skill or lack thereof, sacrificing all merit as an artist. In contrast, traditional art should be applauded as a pure portrayal of artistry that encapsulates the artist's passion. Every brushstroke is the result of conscious decision making and soulful intuition, untainted by artificial expedience. Traditional art is perceived as a virtuous craft with a pedigree that negates a reliance on computer technology.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>The Prestige of Traditional Art </h3>
								<p>
									To this day the prestige of traditional art remains prevalent. It is broadly considered the pinnacle of creative expression and talent. People gaze in awe of intricate paintings and ponder the questions: How did they do it? How long did it take? The creative process is often contemplated more than the actual creation as people struggle to comprehend how such a feat achievable with a mere paintbrush. Perhaps they deduce that the sheer immensity of manual skill involved is beyond their capabilities, instilling a heightened feeling of admiration for the artist. Similarly, they might consider the time it takes to produce such artwork and equate it to the quality of the creation, the longer the better. People use computers every day and have garnered an instinctive understanding of their functionality, frequently overestimating their own ability to use them. They are more cognizant of their artistic limitations with pen and paper or paint and canvas than they are with digital interfaces. This disposition has the capacity to stigmatize digital art in the minds of those who deem it to be an abrupt, convenient and inferior art form.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Digital Disrepute</h3>
								<p>
									The contempt for artistic digitization is not unique to visual art as traditional elitism can be encountered wherever technology has integrated with creativity. Electronic music producers are constantly scolded for not using musical instruments in their songs, a necessity of <i>real music</i>. Even filmmakers can be heavily criticized for using too many special effects, regardless of how well they're used. At least initially, there seems to be a reluctance to adopt new technology within the realm of art that is driven by a conservative mentality. A fear of change, especially when that change defies conventional practices. While there are distinctions between artistic methodologies and mediums the similarities persist. All artists begin with a blank canvas and idle tools. They must formulate new works entirely of their on fruition, using only their inspirations, emotions, knowledge, wit and dexterity to manifest original artwork. There are no tricks, shortcuts or computer programs advanced enough to transcend this creative process. The essential ingredients of success and the pathway to mastering any art form have not changed: practice, patience, technique, application and a pinch of natural talent. Perfection is no more and no less attainable then it was before the induction of computers.
								</p>

							<div>
								<h3>Pixel Perfection</h3>
								<p>
									There is a misconception that digital artists are immune to error as the technology they use allows them to remove mistakes in a nondestructive manner (using the 'undo' command). This, however, is only a means of recovery whereas traditional artists might use paint or an eraser to conceal their faults. Although this comfort is advantageous to digital artists it can also conjure complacency and indecision. The pixel precision a digital artist has at their disposal is negligible to their performance as human imperfections will always emerge on the surface; sometimes integral components of the artwork. Finer materials and tools do not produce finer artists and this is consistent across all practices, so why are digital artists (in some circles) still looked upon with such disdain? It seems the motive for traditional artists attempt to debase the digital movement is one of survival. 
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Artistic Ambiguity</h3>
								<p>
									There is a genuine threat of obscurity confronting traditional art in society as it becomes more challenging for people to discern the differences between artistic styles. If a digital painting is printed on canvas, framed and hung on a wall does it become traditional art? Does the opposite happen when an oil painting is photographed, scanned and uploaded on the internet for all to see? To the untrained eye, it would be near impossible to distinguish the two without a supporting description or artist statement. This gray area predicament is not nearly as worrying as it may suggest, however, because visual stimulation still sustains and audience's need to invest more time learning the details of the work. Much like the grand spectacle of a skyscraper evokes more curiosity than a common building constructed with the same machinery and materials. Inquisitiveness is drowned in apathy if, at first, one is not attracted by the basic elements of linework, colour, shape, form, space and texture. The composition of these elements to express a concept, however subtle or abstract, is what captures an audiences attention and instills the need to know the method of creation. The aesthetic quality of art will always determine an onlooker's appraisal but, from a potential client's perspective, the digital process is much more feasible.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>The Digital Climate</h3>
								<p>
									Traditional artists, like most creators, take pride in their profession, one that is notoriously difficult for establishing a reputation and profiting financially. This is partially due to the commercial demand for digital artists and, more specifically, the way they fulfill client specifications and deadlines. They are preferred not because they are superior artists but instead due to the proficiency of their work: fast, relatively inexpensive and accommodating. Although the chance of prospering as an artist is greater in the digital domain, this is more indicative of the modern business climate and not a sign of societal depreciation of traditional art. The global reach, marketing and social propensity of the internet has, in fact, thrown a lifeline to traditional artists who would have struggled to gain exposure otherwise. There will always be a certain sentimental value attached to traditional art that cannot be replicated digitally. The incessant competition between genres will be a fruitless enterprise so long as introspection and personal biases remain at the essence art. All disciplines of traditional art have endured adversity throughout history and a shift towards technology will not compromise their significance in the modern world.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Finding the Medium</h3>
								<p>
									Coexistence between traditional and digital art has been the reality for several decades. A synergy between the two has evolved during this time that has reinvigorated a passion for art, inspiring creators and consumers alike. The artistic process is no longer black and white with many artists choosing to combine the strengths of one approach in a way the complements the other. Many ideas hidden inside dusty old sketchbooks can be beautifully re-imagined on a computer screen just as the original splendor of a photograph is only enhanced through the expert use of editing software. To overtly dismiss the positive implication of the digital era and its influence on the progression of art and the artists who have embraced it is a senseless endeavour and riddled with insecurity. There may come a time where the human component that constitutes art is replaced by artificial intelligence, justifying the classification of <i>real art</i>. Until then that term is reserved for a conservative minority and not an accepted public opinion. Strip an artist of their tools and they will find another way to tell their stories.
